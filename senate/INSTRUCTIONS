The main file for this question is mrf_question.m.  For most parts of this
question you only need to fill in your code in the corresponding sections
in mrf_question.m.

For part b) you need to first implement the computation of sufficient
statistics in suffStats.m, and then implement the log-likelihood
computation in isingLlik.m.

For part h) you can use the GraphLayout package to visualize a graph
structure, take a look at the corresponding section in mrf_question.m for
an example.  You are also free to use other visualization tools.

Helper functions:
- unnormProb.m computes the unnormalized log-probability, i.e.
        sum_s theta_s x_s + sum_{s,t} theta_{st} x_s x_t
  for all 2^N possible joint states of x.

- margProb.m computes the unary and pairwise marginal probabilities.

- getAdjacency.m computes the adjacency matrix of a graph from the given
  parameter vector.
